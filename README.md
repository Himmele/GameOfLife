## Conway's Game of Life written in 42 lines of NetLogo code ##

### The must have piece of source code for a Coderetreat :-) ###

If you join the Global Day of Coderetreat on December, 8th 2012 you might be interested in a 42 line source code solution that can be done is just a few minutes.
And it even has a working graphical user interface. Ok, I think I miss the whole point of a coderetreat but you really can get things done :-).
Maybe I am too pragmatic about this... ;-)
